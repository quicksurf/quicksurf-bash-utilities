========================

This is a collection of useful bash scripts that I've developed over the years to shorten common stuff that I do all the time.

Usage
=====

To start using these scripts, simply include the local path of this repo in your $PATH environment variable and they should start magically start working once you re-login into your bash profile.

Notes
=====

I primarily use Apple's OS X on a day-to-day basis, so these scripts are primarily written to work in that environment, however, with that being said, I also use them in a couple of different flavors of Linux and on FreeBSD, so I've made some effort to make them fairly generic and platform agnostic, which allows them to basically just work with very few exceptions as long as you have a relatively recent version of bash.

Now that that's out of the way, to find out what each script does, I've gone to the effort of commenting them along with a brief explanation of what it does, so to find out what each script does, simply cat it from the command line or open it in your text editor of choice.

Also, most of these scripts are pretty specific to my system and my particular workflows of trying to get things done, however, I have categorized the scripts into a couple of different categories, so the scripts that may be of most interest will have the string "#SCRIPT_CATEGORY:GENERAL" There is also a GIT category and a PERSONAL category. The git category shortens up a bunch of git commands and the personal category really only applies to me, unless you want replicate how I do things on my system.

The scripts tend to build on top of each other, so scripts in GIT tend to use scripts in GENERAL, and scripts in PERSONAL tend to use scripts in GENERAL and GIT. I'll also be adding other categories over time. I may add them here, or, if somebody wants to, go for it.

Once last note, this is a new repo for me, so I'll be adding scripts into this repo as I have time to migrate them over and categorize/comment them. This is by no means the full collection of my stuff, just the stuff I've had time/energy to make public.

Have fun, and remember, this is here to make life easier, if it doesn't, then don't use it or make it better! :-)
